                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                During the construction of the robot, there were many ideas floating around. These ideas
                                converged
                                and
                                evolved over time. As we encountered mistakes, we corrected them, leading to the
                                creation of
                                this
                                robot.
                                Initially, the robot's concept involved an articulated forearm design that could move up
                                and
                                down, a
                                concept used by other teams as well. However, even though we transitioned to a fixed
                                angle later
                                on,
                                our
                                mission was to adapt to every alliance's needs, and we couldn't achieve this with the
                                fixed
                                angle.
                                To
                                address this issue, we adopted the system used by the Everybot to score in the
                                amphitheater,
                                modifying
                                it into a telescopic arm to prevent it from getting caught on chains.

                                                aimed at fostering equal opportunities in Şırnak, a small province in
                                                Turkey. Over the course of 10 weeks, we conducted classes covering
                                                various subjects such as C#, Tinkercad, and Scratch. We even had the
                                                privilege of sponsoring two exceptional students to represent Şırnak in
                                                the Marmara Regional competition in Istanbul, covering all their
                                                expenses through generous sponsorships.

                                                The school we collaborated with faces significant challenges due to poor
                                                infrastructure, yet they are unwavering in their commitment to provide
                                                quality education. In a testament to their dedication, they repurposed a
                                                teacher's room into a fully functional classroom. Despite grappling with
                                                internet connectivity issues and other adversities, we remained
                                                steadfast in our mission. We firmly believe that where there's a will to
                                                learn, there's a way to overcome obstacles.

                                                resources, we established a laboratory equipped with 10 computers in
                                                Şırnak. This initiative not only facilitates the implementation of our

                                                Two years ago, there was a very strong earthquake in this region and
                                                millions of people were affected by this earthquake, especially children
                                                could not continue their normal education in schools. We are introducing

                                interest in engineering, and teach FIRST values. Various activities are being carried

                                activities, students with interests and talents are selected to form an FLL Jr. Team at

                                explanations about our purpose, our activities, and our identity. As Caracal Robotics,

                                                As 9545 Caracal Robotics, we are conscious and aware youths aiming to
                                                draw attention to an endangered species, as implied by our team name.
                                                Since the inception of our team, we have continuously sought answers to
                                                what we can do for humanity or the world.

                                                As a team valuing the importance of healing our wounds together and
                                                unity within society, we highly regard civil society organizations. For
                                                instance, through collaborative efforts with prominent civil society
                                                organizations like LÖSEV, we aim to raise and instill awareness,
                                                particularly regarding leukemia, and contribute to the fight against
                                                cancer. Additionally, our members who volunteer at organizations such as
                                                TEMA and the Red Crescent (Kızılay) tirelessly work for the
                                                betterment of society.

                                This year, we reached more than 8,000 companies via e-mail, Linkedin or our own
                                acquaintances.
                                80 of them requested to meet with us and 25 of them have now become our sponsors. We
                                received a
                                total
                                of $44,000 in sponsorship support this season, and in addition to all our expenses, we
                                now have
                                $6,000. In addition to these sponsorship supports, there is a company that is special
                                for us and
                                that is DigiMondi.

                                DigiMondi is our partner rather than our sponsor. This company is actually a digital
                                agency. We
                                advertise DigiMondi to the companies we meet with, and as a result, if DigiMondi gets a
                                job
                                thanks to us, we receive 50% of their earnings into our account, so there is a constant
                                flow of
                                money into our account even if we do not do sponsorship work at that moment.
